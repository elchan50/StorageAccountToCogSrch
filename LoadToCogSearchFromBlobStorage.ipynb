Microsoft Fabric Lake is also known as OneLake. It's built into the Fabric service and provides a unified location to store all organizational data where the experiences operate.\\nOneLake is built on top of ADLS (Azure Data Lake Storage) Gen2. It provides a single SaaS experience and a tenant-wide store for data that serves both professional and citizen developers. The OneLake SaaS experience simplifies the experiences, eliminating the need for users to understand any infrastructure concepts such as resource groups, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), Azure Resource Manager, redundancy, or regions. Additionally it doesn't require the user to even have an Azure account.\\nOneLake eliminates today's pervasive and chaotic data silos, which individual developers create when they provision and configure their own isolated storage accounts. Instead, OneLake provides a single, unified storage system for all developers, where discovery and data sharing is trivial and compliance with policy and security settings are enforced centrally and uniformly. For more information, see What is OneLake?\\nOrganizational structure of OneLake and lakehouse\\nOneLake is hierarchical in nature to simplify management across your organization. It's built into Microsoft Fabric and there's no requirement for any up-front provisioning. There's only one OneLake per tenant and it provides a single-pane-of-glass file-system namespace that spans across users, regions and even clouds. The data in OneLake is divided into manageable containers for easy handling.\\nThe tenant maps to the root of OneLake and is at the top level of the hierarchy. You can create any number of workspaces within a tenant, which can be thought of as folders.\\nThe following image shows the various Fabric items where data is stored. It's an example of how various items within Fabric would store data inside OneLake. As displayed, you can create multiple workspaces within a tenant, create multiple lakehouses within each workspace. A lakehouse is a collection of files, folders, and tables that represents a database over a data lake. To learn more, see What is a lakehouse?. \"), (6, 8758, \"Every developer and business unit in the tenant can instantly create their own workspaces in OneLake. They can ingest data into their own lakehouses, start processing, analyzing, and collaborating on the data, just like OneDrive in Office.\\nAll the Microsoft Fabric compute experiences are prewired to OneLake, just like the Office applications are prewired to use the organizational OneDrive.

The size of the capacity determines the amount of computation power reserved for users of that capacity. The amount of compute resources is based on the SKU.\\nWith a Fabric (Preview) trial, you get full access to all of the Fabric experiences and features. You also get OneLake storage up to 1 TB. Create Fabric items and collaborate with others in the same Fabric trial capacity. With a Fabric (Preview) trial, you can:\\n. Create workspaces (folders) for projects that support Fabric capabilities.\\n. Share Fabric items, such as datasets, warehouses, and notebooks, and collaborate on them with other Fabric users.\\nCreate analytics solutions using these Fabric items.\\nYou don\\'t have access to your capacity until you put something into it. To begin using your Fabric (Preview) trial, add items to My workspace or create a new workspace.

These CUs allow users of your trial capacity to consume 64x60 CU seconds every minute. Every time the Fabric trial capacity is used, it consumes CUs. The Fabric platform aggregates consumption from all experiences and applies it to your reserved capacity. Not all functions have the same consumption rate. For example, running a Data Warehouse might consume more capacity units than authoring a Power BI report. When the capacity consumption exceeds its size, Microsoft slows down the experience similar to slowing down CPU performance.\\nThere's no limit on the number of workspaces or items you can create within your capacity. The only constraint is the availability of capacity units and the rate at which you consume them.\\nYou're the capacity owner for your trial capacity.

Capacity defines the ability of a resource to perform an activity or to produce output. Different items consume different capacity at a certain time. Fabric offers capacity through the Fabric SKU and Trials. For more information, see What is capacity?\\nExperience: A collection of capabilities targeted to a specific functionality. The Fabric experiences include Synapse Data Warehouse, Synapse Data Engineering, Synapse Data Science, Synapse Real-Time Analytics, Data Factory and Power BI.\\nItem: An item a set of capabilities within an experience. Users can create, edit, and delete them. Each item type provides different capabilities. For example, the Data Engineering experience includes the lakehouse, notebook, and Spark job definition items.\\nTenant: A tenant is a single instance of Fabric for an organization and is aligned with an Azure Active Directory.\\nWorkspace: A workspace is a collection of items that brings together different functionality in a single environment designed for collaboration. It acts as a container that leverages capacity for the work that is executed, and provides controls for who can access the items in it. For example, in a workspace, users create reports, notebooks, datasets, etc. For more information, see Workspaces article.\\nSynapse Data Engineering :unselected: :unselected: :unselected: '), (22, 40745, \"Lakehouse: A lakehouse is a collection of files, folders, and tables that represent a database over a data lake used by the Apache Spark engine and SQL engine for big data processing. A lakehouse includes enhanced capabilities for ACID transactions when using the open-source Delta formatted tables. The lakehouse item is hosted within a unique workspace folder in Microsoft OneLake. It contains files in various formats (structured and unstructured) organized in folders and subfolders. For more information, see What is a lakehouse?\\nNotebook: A Fabric notebook is a multi-language interactive programming tool with rich functions. Which include authoring code and markdown, running and monitoring a Spark job, viewing and visualizing result, and collaborating with the team. It helps data engineers and data scientist to explore and process data, and build machine learning experiments with both code and low-code experience. It can be easily transformed to a pipeline activity for orchestration.\\nSpark application: An Apache Spark application is a program written by a user using one of Spark's API languages (Scala, Python, Spark SQL, or Java) or Microsoft-added languages (.NET with C# or F#). When an application runs, it's divided into one or more Spark jobs that run in parallel to process the data faster. For more information, see Spark application monitoring.\\nApache Spark job: A Spark job is part of a Spark application that is run in parallel with other jobs in the application. A job consists of multiple tasks. For more information, see Spark job monitoring.\\nApache Spark job definition: A Spark job definition is a set of parameters, set by the user, indicating how a Spark application should be run. It allows you to submit batch or streaming jobs to the Spark cluster. For more information, see What is an Apache Spark job definition?\\nV-order: A write optimization to the parquet file format that enables fast reads and provides cost efficiency and better performance. All the Fabric engines write v- ordered parquet files by default.\\nData Factory\\nConnector: Data Factory offers a rich set of connectors that allow you to connect to different types of data stores. Once connected, you can transform the data. For more information, see connectors.\\nData pipeline: In Data Factory, a data pipeline is used for orchestrating data movement and transformation. These pipelines are different from the deployment :unselected: :unselected: :unselected: :unselected: :unselected: :selected: :unselected: :unselected: :unselected: :unselected: :unselected: \"), (23, 43309, \"pipelines in Fabric.

Dataflows in Fabric are referred to as Dataflow Gen2. Dataflow Gen1 exists in Power BI. Dataflow Gen2 offers extra capabilities compared to Dataflows in Azure Data Factory or Power BI. You can't upgrade from Gen1 to Gen2. For more information, see Dataflows in the Data Factory overview.\\nSynapse Data Science\\nData Wrangler: Data Wrangler is a notebook-based tool that provides users with an immersive experience to conduct exploratory data analysis. The feature combines a grid-like data display with dynamic summary statistics and a set of common data-cleansing operations, all available with a few selected icons. Each operation generates code that can be saved back to the notebook as a reusable script.\\nExperiment: A machine learning experiment is the primary unit of organization and control for all related machine learning runs. For more information, see Machine learning experiments in Microsoft Fabric.\\nModel: A machine learning model is a file trained to recognize certain types of patterns. You train a model over a set of data, and you provide it with an algorithm that it uses to reason over and learn from that data set. For more information, see Machine learning model.\\n£\\nRun: A run corresponds to a single execution of model code. In MLflow , tracking is based on experiments and runs.\\nSynapse data warehousing\\nSQL Endpoint: Each Lakehouse has a SQL Endpoint that allows a user to query delta table data with TSQL over TDS.

These external systems include databases, file systems, and APIs. Leo doesn’t want to write and maintain code for each connector or data movement operation. He wants to follow the medallion layers best practices, with bronze, silver, and gold. Leo doesn't have any experience with Spark, so he prefers the drag and drop UI as much as possible, with minimal coding. And he also wants to process the data on a schedule.\\nThe first step is to get the raw data into the bronze layer lakehouse from Azure data resources and various third party sources (like Snowflake Web, REST, AWS S3, GCS, etc.). He wants a consolidated lakehouse, so that all the data from various LOB, on-premises, and cloud sources reside in a single place. Leo reviews the options and selects pipeline copy activity as the appropriate choice for his raw binary copy. This pattern applies to both historical and incremental data refresh. With copy activity, Leo can load Gold data to a data warehouse with no code if the need arises and pipelines provide high scale data ingestion that can move petabyte-scale data. Copy activity is the best low-code and no-code choice to move petabytes of data to lakehouses and warehouses from varieties of sources, either ad-hoc or via a schedule.\\nScenario2 \"), (50, 103216, \"Mary is a data engineer with a deep knowledge of the multiple LOB analytic reporting requirements. An upstream team has successfully implemented a solution to migrate multiple LOB's historical and incremental data into a common lakehouse. Mary has been tasked with cleaning the data, applying business logics, and loading it into multiple destinations (such as Azure SQL DB, ADX, and a lakehouse) in preparation for their respective reporting teams.\\nMary is an experienced Power Query user, and the data volume is in the low to medium range to achieve desired performance. Dataflows provide no-code or low-code interfaces for ingesting data from hundreds of data sources. With dataflows, you can transform data using 300+ data transformation options, and write the results into multiple destinations with an easy to use, highly visual user interface. Mary reviews the options and decides that it makes sense to use Dataflow Gen 2 as her preferred transformation option.\\nScenario3\\nAdam is a data engineer working for a large retail company that uses a lakehouse to store and analyze its customer data. As part of his job, Adam is responsible for building and maintaining the data pipelines that extract, transform, and load data into the lakehouse. One of the company's business requirements is to perform customer review analytics to gain insights into their customers' experiences and improve their services.\\nAdam decides the best option is to use Spark to build the extract and transformation logic. Spark provides a distributed computing platform that can process large amounts of data in parallel. He writes a Spark application using Python or Scala, which reads structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from OneLake for customer reviews and feedback. The application cleanses, transforms, and writes data to Delta tables in the lakehouse.

They are ready to get started cleaning, modeling, and analyzing data but need to decide to build a data warehouse or a lakehouse. After review of the details in the previous table, the primary decision points are the available skill set and the need for multi-table transactions.\\nSusan has spent many years building data warehouses on relational database engines, and is familiar with SQL syntax and functionality. Thinking about the larger team, the primary consumers of this data are also skilled with SQL and SQL analytical tools. Susan decides to use a data warehouse, which allows the team to interact primarily with T- SQL, while also allowing any Spark users in the organization to access the data.\\nScenario 2\\nRob, a data engineer, needs to store and model several terabytes of data in Fabric. The team has a mix of PySpark and T-SQL skills. Most of the team running T-SQL queries are consumers, and therefore don't need to write INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements. The remaining developers are comfortable working in notebooks, and because the data is stored in Delta, they're able to interact with a similar SQL syntax.\\nRob decides to use a lakehouse, which allows the data engineering team to use their diverse skills against the data, while allowing the team members who are highly skilled in T-SQL to consume the data.\\nScenario 3\\nAsh, a citizen developer, is a Power BI developer. They're familiar with Excel, Power BI, and Office. They need to build a data product for a business unit. They know they don't quite have the skills to build a data warehouse or a lakehouse, and those seem like too much for their needs and data volumes. They review the details in the previous table \"), (54, 110612, 'and see that the primary decision points are their own skills and their need for a self service, no code capability, and data volume under 100 GB.\\nAsh works with business analysts familiar with Power BI and Microsoft Office, and knows that they already have a Premium capacity subscription. As they think about their larger team, they realize the primary consumers of this data may be analysts, familiar with no- code and SQL analytical tools. Ash decides to use a Power BI datamart, which allows the team to interact build the capability fast, using a no-code experience. Queries can be executed via Power BI and T-SQL, while also allowing any Spark users in the organization to access the data as well.\\nScenario 4\\nDaisy is business analyst experienced with using Power BI to analyze supply chain bottlenecks for a large global retail chain. They need to build a scalable data solution that can handle billions of rows of data and can be used to build dashboards and reports that can be used to make business decisions. The data comes from plants, suppliers, shippers, and other sources in various structured, semi-structured, and unstructured formats.\\nDaisy decides to use a KQL Database because of its scalability, quick response times, advanced analytics capabilities including time series analysis, geospatial functions, and fast direct query mode in Power BI.
