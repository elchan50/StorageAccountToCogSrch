The timely collection of the assessments from all homeowners is important to the management and operation of the project, and to the preservation of property values. Pursuant to California Civil Code §1365(d), the Association has adopted the following policy for the collection of delinquent assessments.\\n1. Annual assessments shall be paid monthly in twelve (12) equal installments. Each installment is due on the first day of the month. Any regular assessment not paid by the thirtieth (30th) of the month shall be considered delinquent; any special assessment levied shall be considered delinquent thirty days after the date due, unless otherwise specified by the Board of Directors. A late charge of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be levied on all delinquent assessments. Any assessment not paid within thirty (30) days of the date due shall accrue interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. If a check is returned for insufficient funds, the owner will be charged a Twenty Dollar ($20.00) fee.\\n2. Upon any installment becoming delinquent, the Association, through its designated agent, shall mail a notice to the owner via certified mail to pay the account in full within ten (10) days or a lien will be recorded against the owner's property. Should the owner fail to bring the account current pursuant to the Association's demand, the Association will cause a lien to be recorded against the owner's property.\\n3. Within ten (10) days after a lien is recorded for delinquent assessments, the Association will mail a copy of the lien to all record owners of the property as set forth in Civil Code §2924b.\\n4. After thirty (30) days has passed since recordation of a lien for delinquent assessments, the Association will diligently proceed with foreclosure. In lieu of foreclosure, or concurrently therewith, a lawsuit may be filed against the owner personally if the Association concludes such action will enhance the prospect of recovering the delinquent assessments, or will otherwise be in the best interest of the Association.\\n5.

Subject to the provisions of Section 16.5 hereof, the Association shall comply with the provisions of Civil Code \"Section 1368.4, Civil Code Sections 910 through 938, and any successor statutes or laws, prior to the filing of any civil action by the Association against the Declarant or other developer of the Community for either alleged damage to the Association Property or other property within the Community that the Association is obligated to maintain or repair, or alleged damage to any other portion of the Community that arises out of, or is integrally related to, such damage to the Association Property or other property within the Community that the Association is obligated to maintain or repair.

These procedures impact the legal rights of Owners with respect to the Property. According to the terms of the Civil Code, the Non-Adversarial Procedures will not apply if Declarant does not or cannot comply with the requirements set forth therein if a claim arises. If the Non-Adversarial Procedures provided in Civil Code Sections 910 through 938 fail to resolve any Construction Defect Claims, such Construction Defect Claims shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth below.\\n16.6 ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. If any Construction Defect Claim is not resolved through the Non-Adversarial Procedures, or there is any other dispute between any Owner or the Association and Declarant which is not a Warranty Claim (individually referred to herein as \"Dispute\" and collectively as \"Disputes\"), the parties will proceed to mediation according to the procedures set forth in Section 16.6.1 below. Disputes between the Association and Declarant which are not resolved by the mediation process and are not Construction Defect Claims (\"Binding Arbitration Disputes\") will be decided through binding arbitration as set forth in Section 16.6.2 below. All other Disputes which are not resolved by the mediation process, will be decided through the non-binding arbitration procedure as set forth in\\n.\\n....\\nKB Home/Foxstone CC&R\\'s 32172-01010 / 1967469.6\\n. .\\na un\\n- -\\n.-...\\n-.. . .....

Each Owner, the Association and Declarant agree to submit any and all Disputes to mediation before commencing arbitration. The cost of mediation shall be paid by Declarant. Each party to the mediation shall bear its own attorneys\\' fees and costs in connection with such mediation.\\n16.6.2 Arbitration. Notwithstanding California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1298.7, Binding Arbitration Disputes shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). All other Disputes which are not resolved by the mediation process shall be resolved through non-binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the AAA.\\n(a) Selection of Arbitrator. There shall be only one arbitrator who shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties.

The arbitration shall commence and conclude promptly, in accordance with the commercial rules of the AAA.\\n(c) Resolution Opportunity. When the arbitrator is prepared to make the award, the arbitrator shall first so inform the parties, who shall have ten (10) days to attempt to resolve the matter by a binding agreement between them. If the parties resolve the matter, the arbitrator shall not make any award. If the parties do not so resolve the matter within the ten (10) day period, the arbitrator shall make the award on the eleventh day following the arbitrator\\'s notice of being prepared to make the award.\\n(d) Fees and Costs. Declarant shall promptly pay the fees necessary to initiate, prosecute and complete the arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator may award the prevailing party those costs that would be awarded to the prevailing party under California law if the matter had been resolved by court trial. In addition, to the extent permitted by law, the arbitrator may award or divide the post-initiation arbitration fees and costs to prosecute and complete the arbitration as the arbitrator finds just and reasonable, subject to the restrictions set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1284.3(a). If the arbitrator makes no award or division of such arbitration fees and costs, the parties shall divide them equally with each party bearing one-half of such fees and costs of the arbitration, to the extent permitted by law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties shall each bear their own costs, expenses and attorneys\\' fees.\\nKB Home/Foxstone CC&R\\'s 32172-01010 /1967469.6\\n------ '), (74, 241404, '(e) Preliminary Procedures. If state or federal law requires an Owner, the Association or Declarant to take steps or procedures before commencing an action in arbitration, then the Owner, the Association or Declarant must take such steps or follow such procedures, as the case may be, before commencing the arbitration. For example, any claim or Disputes pursuant to California Civil Code Section 895 et seq., as hereafter amended may be subject to the Non-Adversarial Procedures set forth in California Civil Code Section 910 through 93.8, prior to the initiation of any arbitration. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be deemed a waiver or limitation of the provisions of California Civil Code Sections 1368.4, 1375, 1375.05 or 1375.1.\\n(f) Participation by Other Parties. An Owner, the Association and \" Declarant, to the extent any such party is defending a claim in the arbitration, may, if it chooses, have all necessary and appropriate parties included as parties to the arbitration.\\n(g) Decisions. The parties agree that the decisions of the arbitrators for all Disputes shall be non-binding and appealable, except that the decisions of the arbitrators for Binding Arbitration Disputes shall be binding and non-appealable.\\n(h) Judgment by a Court. Judgment upon the decision rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement.\\n(i) Federal Arbitration Act. Because many of the materials and products incorporated into the home are manufactured in other states, the development and conveyance of the Property evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1 et seq.) now in effect and as it may be hereafter amended will govern the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration provisions set forth herein.\\n16.6.3 AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.\\n(a) ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES.
